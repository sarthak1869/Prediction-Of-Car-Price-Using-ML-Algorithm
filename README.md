# Prediction-Of-Car-Price-Using-ML-Algorithm

This project focuses on predicting car prices using various machine learning algorithms. The model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (Car_price.ipynb) and evaluates different ML techniques to determine the most accurate model.

# Features

Data preprocessing and augmentation
Deep learning model (e.g., CNN)
Performance evaluation metrics
Visualization of model performance

# Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

# Dataset

The provided dataset is taken from kaggle website.

# Results 

Implemented various ML Algorithms such as Linear Regression,KNN,Decision Tree, Random Forest,SVR and checked the r2 score to see which model is most suitable.
